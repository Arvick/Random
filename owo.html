                            <li>China’s government confirms that health workers were treating numerous cases. A few days later, it’s identified that the virus ha infected many people across Asia, the main symptoms being a fever and shortness of breath, but since there was no evidence present that the virus could be spread among humans, all health officials could do was monitor it to prevent it from developing further and investigate the origins of the virus.

                            <ol>Jan. 11th: First Signs of Trouble
                                <li>China reports its first death from the virus, a 61-year old man who was a regular at a market where it first originated. The patient in question had been suffering with shortness of breath and pneumonia. Unfortunately, this occurred around one of the worst times for a virus like this, where many Chinese travel across the country to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
                                </li>
                                <li>China’s transport ministry announces greater measures to prevent transmission of disease during the Lunar New Year’s hectic 40-day travel period (disinfecting transportation vehicles)
                                </li>
                                <li>Additional potential cases are reported in other places (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan) due to the influx of Chinese travelers
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <ol>Jan. 20th: The Spread
                                <li>The first confirmed cases outside of China are reported in Japan, South korea, and Thailand. The following day, the first case in the US is confirmed to be a 30-something year old man in Washington State returning from a trip to Wuhan.
                                </li>
                                <li>While many patients in China had made contact with the food market in Wuhan, this patient reported that he was merely travelling through, having not visited the market at all.</li>
                                <li>This new case leads the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security's Customs/Border Protection to roll out “enhanced health screenings” at airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan, starting with SFO, JFK, and LAX. It also confirms that person-to-person spread of the virus is occurring
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <ol>Jan. 23th: Wuhan Goes Into Lockdown
                                <li>Chinese authorities forcefully closed off Wuhan in an attempt to prevent further spread of the virus, suspending all transportation services operating within it, effectively putting the city into lockdown, with planes and trains going in and out of the city being cancelled.
                                </li>
                                <li>With this sudden lockdown, some civilians feel safe and have faith in the government's action, while others are in a panicked state due to the decline in essential resources and everyone in a rush to buy goods, stating that the residents need to be able to live and eat normally.
                                </li>
                                <li>Mandatory mask-wearing is put into place.

                            <ol>Jan. 30th: W.H.O declares “global health emergency”
                                <li>With a huge surge in cases in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) declares a public health emergency, meaning the virus has become widespread enough to expand internationally and has to be responded to in a coordinated manner.
                                </li>
                                <li>China’s Foreign Ministry says that it would continue efforts with the WHO and other countries to protect the public. The US state department warns travelers to steer clear of China. 
                                </li>
                                <li>With the WHO’s declaration, efforts begin to gather financial and political support to suppress the virus
                                </li>

                                <li>A 44-year old Chinese man in the Philippines who recently flew in from Wuhan died of the virus, marking the first official death outside China.

                                <li>US, Australia, and New Zealand announces barring of foreign nationals from entering the country. Citizens who have visited China are permitted, but they will be quarantined

                                <li>Numerous countries have evacuated and quarantined many of their citizens. Airlines suspend flights to China

                            <ol>Feb. 7th: Dr Li Wenliang
                                <li>After Wenliang, a Chinese doctor, died of the virus, he was seen as a hero who made valiant efforts that the virus infections could skyrocket when it was still in its early stages. However, the authorities forced him to retract hsi warning. His death led to a frustrated reaction at the Chinese government's handling of his statements.
                                </li>
                                <li>Specifically, the Chinese government had mistakenly declared Wenliang as dead, then alive, then declared his official death, invoking an emotional response of outrage from shocked citizens who demanded the right to free speech.
