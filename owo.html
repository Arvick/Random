                                <li>Many employees were laid off/businesses had closed down. The reasons for this include a lack of demand, employee health concerns, and reduced employment dueto fear of the virus. Although businesses have been gradually recovering since the lockdown began, none have been able to get back to the number of employees and locations, as well as working hours/conditions they had before, and they are still struggling financially.

Some have reported temporary closure, others have reported a permanent closure, and still others report remaining operational (albeit with modified operations).

                                        <li>Older people, being the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, are also vulnerable to a lack of care. If integrated incorrectly, social distancing measures can also cut off the elderly from both social and medical support they may need to live.

                                        <li>This significant vulnerability to the coronavirus, however, has also led to a developing stigma of old people being weak and useless to society. This discirmination has manifested itself in the form of protizong healthcare services for the young over the old, increased isolation, and unequal opportunity for healthcare. In addition, this age disciminaion can also cut off the elderly’s access to important services and resources, resulting in increased isolation, which can prove detrimental towards their mental health, and a lack of foodstuffs, both leading to higher mortality rates.

Additionally, care workers also face a dilemma when helping the elderly, as the essential help they provide gives great risk to spreading the viru.

The disabled, as a result, are more likely to have decaying health at a time like this.

                                        <li>Self-care hygienic measures, such as personal hygiene and surfacer cleaning, may be more difficult to perform for a person with disabilities than a person without. Services that would usually help the disabled (now including drive-up testing) are cut off from them during the pandemic, so they will not be able to take measures to protect themselves (Cleaning the house/washing hands). Communication is also a problem, as certain disabilities may make it difficult or near impossible for people to receive important updates on the pandemic.

                                        <li>During this time of social isolation, the youth have also been greatly affected. With many businesses and industries shutting down, this unemployment will impact the youth greatly, as they are already 3x more likely than adults to be unemployed, and this current situation will only make that worse. In addition, this will also reduce the quality of jobs that young people can still get (lower/reduced pay, more complicated work environments). To top it all off, youth whose job requires them to work in-person are at higher risk of contracting the virus.

                                        <li>As the youth bear witness to actions being taken in the midst of the pandemic, they have developed a distrust of current institutions and their actions, resulting in many youth disobeying their warnings. Due to their excessively casual outlook on the pandemic from a reportedly lower risk and a disregard of warnings, an increasing number of young people have been reported among the infection and death count. This current state of affairs has also prompted many of them to begin to contemplate big questions regarding morals, mortality, and meaning.

                                        <li>Social distancing also has a big impact on young people’s social developments, as due to their desire to make new social connections outside of their family, some youth may be unable to comprehend the full significance of the virus. Their inability to make new connections also hampers developments of social skills/understanding and self-reflection, which may lead to many students having setbacks in educational and social skills.

                                        <li>The pandemic also has a disproportionate effect on young people in lower-income communities, as with lack of food, unstable housing conditions, loss of income, and more death and illness, these issues are only further worsened as young people in these communities are barred from receiving support in the form of technology and communication, as well as isolation inside an environment that may be violent or abusive.

Many recycling plants have suspended activity out of fear of spreading the virus, adn a lack of cargo transportation has resulted in un-shippabel agriculture and fish products. Producers also export too much goods. Many food retailers have switched back to plastic bags, while consumers have seen ana increase in the amount of take-out and delivery food ordered, which further contributes to produced waste. Due to this waste, levels of methane and greenhouse gases from decomposing produce are predicted to rise greatly.

                                                <li>China touts the image of them as a global leader with highly successful quarantine measures; however, their attempts to falsify an image of stability have brought their censorship to other nation’s attention
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>After its economy suffered a major contraction due to the lockdown, China was hesitant on initiating a global recovery, as in the time since the last economic crisis in 2008, the government debt has doubled, and many are reluctant to spend so much money this time.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Japan: Thank Their Customs</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Initially, Japan’s response to the coronavirus was not very well thought out, with accusations of disregarding the threat the virus presented and inefficient mesures, such as the Diamond Princess lockdown and testing too few people. In addition, there was also the shaky actions of prime minister Shinzo Abe, whose performance in the pandemic has been questionable, with lackluster communication and safety measures, and a lack of legal power to implement a lockdown
                                        </li>
                                        <li>However, it wasn’t Abe’s measures, but rather Japan’s customary (personal and cultural) measures and habits, such as bowing, the removal of shoes when entering a household, universal healthcare, and general habits of the Japanese, that have allowed for the decrease in infection numbers
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Japan was also quick to close down mass gatherings such as museums, theaters, and sporting events.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>It shouldn’t be forgotten, however, that Japan’s economy has been hit very hard, and extensive measures, including a $1 trillion relief package and cash packages to citizens, are being taken to maintain the stability of employment and people’s lives.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Europe: Zero Coordination</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>European country's response to the pandemic was mainly inefficient and non-focused. Many leaders went on trips and made physical contact, and UK politicians had their main focus squarely on Brexit, despite having a well-informed population and a good healthcare system. Europe also didn’t ban trans-state movement or account for the hospitals’ inability to handle this new virus, and failed to coordinate a safe and effective response that worked across all the countries.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Initially, the ECB (European Central Bank) had a slow response to the outbreak. However, they soon buckled down, launching new measures to keep the economy afloat, such as the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, that buys up national debts, which means that when they buy these bonds, interest rates will lower. This will help governments to continue economic activity, creating jobs and growing the economy.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The effect the virus has on European countries differs across each one, causing internal conflict among them. With each country having a different status on financial wealth and the capabilities of their health systems, the response lacks uniformity, with some countries being able to provide more emergency funds than others. The countries also struggled to come up with a unified plan, eventually settling on a stimulus package to support states, companies, businesses, and workers (for those who have lost their job/ a significant cut of their paycheck).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Most of the countries have now closed down travel and schools/major gatheirngs and implemented lockdowns. However, the measures they put in place still vary from country to country.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Korea: Different Sides</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>North: The Propaganda Speaks For Them
                                        </li>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>North Korea has touted that with their swift and efficient measures, combined with their already restrictive laws on movement within and in and out of the country, there are no coronavirus cases. This resulted in high levels of propaganda, including photos of citizens wearing masks and practicing social distancing and workers wearing protective gear, being thrown around to show the strength of Kim Jong-Un’s leadership and protect his reputation.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>However, based on its location between China and South Korea, which both have thousands of cases, as well as reports of the North Korean military having seen numerous deaths and a state of lockdown, this claim of “zero cases” and no fatalities  is highly doubted to be true.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>On the side, the government secretly asks for help from the WHO and Doctors Without Borders, as they recognize the country’s weak public health systems/testing capabilities and the malnourishment of almost half of the population.
                                                </li>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The initial response to the outbreak in South Korea was less than satisfactory, with the leading administration struggling to get a hold on handling the crisis, as evidenced by the inconsistent statements from the government and controversy over how they handled the Shincheonji Church incident as well as a party the main administer Moon Jae-in hosted for the success of the film “Parasite”. All of this contributed to the sense that the government had little control over the situation.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Later on, however, the government managed to get it together and started to combat the outbreak. In late January, Seoul issued an order to 20 medical companies to begin rapid production of tests with promises of fast approval, and this later progressed to shipping tests all over to where they were needed, as well as a complex network of healthcare institutions (hospitals, clinics, testing kiosks). This led to relatively low rates of infections within the country.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Soon, South Korea was being praised for its model of efficient measures taken, especially its openness and capability and its ability to keep the public safe without widespread travel lockdown. The government had given out tests for more citizens than the US had.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Many countries, including the US, are requesting advice and help from South Korea, which plans to export its successful test kits to countries around the world.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>These two responses are to be expected given the two countries’ different environments. North Korea, an oppressive dictatorship that jousts the idea of a holy supreme leader and a hostile outside world, is sure to have a radically different response than South Korea, a civil and free-speaking society with high connectivity and education.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Africa: A Time For Innovation</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The response across the countries in Africa have seen varying success, with some leading in testing capabilities and other ways. Many countries have used this outbreak as a way to improve upon existing healthcare protocols, integrating better response time and modern technology that can help in this time of crisis, as well as implement lockdowns to varying degrees.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>For example, Rwanda acted fast when its first cases were recorded, closing down schools, sending out officials to screen people for infection, and setting up hand washing stations at places where many people would gather. In addition, they also took too sensitive measures to provide food and other necessities to the especially vulnerable people. They also announced a 2-week quarantine which soon extended into a total lockdown of the country. In order to encourage as much isolation as possible, Rwanda promotes digital transactions and online shopping, as well as a relay system for transporting goods and a permission system for people to leave home for essential needs.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Also, Senegal implemented total lockdown and screening booths and response teams, but faced some initial resistance over religious centers being closed. Data shows that rural areas have seen less infections than urban ones. Senegal has also seen higher recovery rates thanks to its efficient treating plans, and plans are being made to develop a quick and cheap diagnostic test to deploy across Africa. The government also created a fund to support those affected majorly by the outbreak, and an app that tracks distribution of food and PPE is in development.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Numerous other countries, including Ghana and Kenya, have implemented new technological innovations to help people in social isolation, whether it be producing PPEs or spreading awareness. They’ve also launched virtual learning platforms over broadcasts, televisions, and other sites.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>With rising case numbers, many governments in the Middle East took initiative and enacted lockdown over the millions of people living there. Their quick containment measures, including declaring a state of national emergency that stopped movement across the countries, suspended religious pilgrimages/gatherings, led to lower death rates. Although the level of success varies across the region, the general trend with Middle Eastern country’s measures success in containing the virus.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Many countries have introduced new technology, such as virtual doctors and sanitizing robots, or made important decisions, such as increasing mask production. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Governments have also been forced to make decisions to help support at-risk communities, showing efficiency in implementing protection and preparing stimulus packages for those out of work in the country. They also created new structures to improve coordination between institutions, technical and scientific boards to monitor and assess the situation (which includes ensuring support for families though goods/services and compliance of the people ifn following safety protocols), and the movement of public services to digital platforms. These digital platforms were also used to spread awareness and promote safety measures through videos with famous actors and influencers and websites that serve to provide the important information and how to keep themselves safe. Also, governments put in measures to keep the acquisition of necessities at the same growing rate as the needs of the people, such as enforcing important institutions and reminders to the public of the limits when buying imported goods. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Additionally, as the death rates begin to lower, many countries have begun strategically relaxing lockdown measures, whether it be in steps or division of areas, as well as starting to reopen businesses. Even as lockdown measures are lifted, safety measures such as social distancing and requiring masks have not gone away or been relaxed. 
                                        </li>
