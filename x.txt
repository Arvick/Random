Don't give up, don't cry

Get back up cuz you won't quit
Keep that smile, keep dreaming

Ain't got time for folks who's trolling
Living moments, fast cars rolling
Lost our way but now we're home in

Love life on my own trendsetter

How my life's my greatest blessing
I'm gone

Think you ain't good enough, stop that
Think you ain't beautiful, stop that
Think you ain't worth it, stop that

Fuck Jake Paul
Let me tell y'all 'bout this fuck Jake Paul
Fake wife, fake life, no talent at all
Let me tell y'all 'bout all of his flaws
Don't get me started about his shitty vlogs
Runs Team 10 like a fake ass boss
It's everyday bro, where's the Disney Channel flow?
Lost your contract, no more Mickey Mouse dough
Put a shirt on, yeah dude you look fat
Act like you buff but it only a two pack
Big on Vine but you should have died with that
It's Everyday Bro, stop fucking saying that
'Cause It's Everynight Sis up in this shit
'Cause It's Everynight Sis, yeah you a bitch
How did God make you? There was probably a glitch
You a fucking liar, you a fucking snitch
All your songs are shit, yeah you need a new niche
Why you tryna' rap? you sound like a bitch
Like a kid from the 'burbs who's parents are rich
Speaking of your parents, did they drop you on your head?
Half the world would be happy if they'd found out you were dead
Trying to distract us with your baby pup
Yeah, Apollo's cute but you still a fuck up
Couldn't sign the Dolans now you need a re-up
One year later Martinez show up

Hold up, hold up, yo, let me stop you real quick
It's Jake Paul, why you're saying all this shit?
"Oh hey Jake, you're a fucking bitch"
Ok, yo, yeah I understand that shit
And I know everything you can say about my clique
And I'm not saying I don't disagree with it
But let me tell you my point of view of it
Man I know all of my flaws, man here it is
I am thirsty for the attention and views
I am a two pack looking tubby ass dude
And yeah that's right, I split from Disney
I'm Jake Paul and you ain't watching shit, B
And yes I was a dumb fifth grade stupid bully
Still regret that shit, man it ain't cooly
And yes I was betrayed, yeah Max, he screwed me
I cried like a bitch 'cause I called him family
His name was under pressure so he did me dirty
But it's all hear say that shit ain't worthy
Don't believe Jake he's not trustworthy
So fuck Jake Paul and what he says
If it weren't for Team 10 then he'd have no friends
But that's not all, let me tell y'all about snake fucking Paul
200,000 people unsubscribed
What happened to "Mr. Pass PewDiePie"?
And yes my brother did kiss my girl
I'm still standing here screaming "Fuck the Free World"
And yes, he passed me in subscribers
But the Logang Paulers are the riders
Jake Paulers you can't divide us
Paul family are multipliers
If we're doing math he's older by two
He's got more subs, I'd hope so dude
And my neighbours wanna move, shit I would too
O.J. out of jail put him next to me
That's a punishment worse than the penalty
But I do fuck up, and sometimes I wanna quit it all
Sometimes I wish I wasn't involved
Sometimes I wish I could hate Jake Paul
I really wanna see that motherfucker fall
From the bottom of my heart, man fuck Jake Paul
Ooh, yeah

Hey sweetie
I'm really concerned about the situation with you and your brother Logan
It is not healthy for either of you so I'm hoping that you guys can do something about it, both of you together and be the loving brothers that I know you are please
I made this in one day
I love you big bro, I love you big bro
And I want you to know
That I'm so sorry
For things I said
Sometimes I wish
That our war would end
I want you to know
They were just jokes
These times they get tough
That's just when we go
Oh why can't it be
Like Ohio
LA changed us
But I want you to know
That I love you bro

He's my lil' bro can't blame him
Kinda hard, but it's my job to tame him
He's a loose cannon, a live wire
But I see that he's calling for a ceasefire
We got the same last name, same blood
So much hate, but where is the love?
Animosity, negativity, what happened to all the smiles and happy energy
Came up in Ohio, wasn't much to do
Then we found this place called YouTube
We made our dreams come true
Work hard and you can too
Yeah we may have had one small brawl
But I can move on, and so should y'all
I will pick him up if he falls
After all it's the Rise of the Pauls

I love you lil' bro, I love you lil' bro
And I want you to know
That I'm so sorry
For things that I said
I just want to be friends
So let's make amends
And be bros til the end

All we have is each other, from the same mother
What more can I ask in a brother?
Shouts out to all the Logang Pauler's
Look up to you everyday bro
Tearing up as I switch the flow
I messed up and it's hard to let go
But You picked me up, when I was on the flo
And I want you to know that I love you bro
And Sometimes I Just wanna run out the door
But I know and I know that I don't really know
But I'm a kid in LA and I'm just trying to grow
And life moving so fast I do and I go
And I been on my own since 17 years old
And all I had with me is my brother Logan
And I want you to know
That I love you bro

I love you my bro, I love you my bro
And I want you to know
That I'm so sorry
For things that I said
I just want to be friends
So let's make amends
And be bros til' the end

Logan, our life's been crazy bro, I
But for real I love you, and like it's like I'm a Logang Pauler
Let's stop the hate, let's keep dabbin' on them haters

I been drinkin', floatin'
Caught in my emotions, losing my mind
I been sinking, copin'
Left my heart broken, I don't know why
I been thinkin', hopin'
Can we leave it open, I just need time
I just need time, but why even try

I'm single, I'm single
I'm single, I'm single

All the time, on my mind
When I'm workin' out (I don't love you no more)
You on the 'Gram, going ham
Say you going out
Well that's fine, that's fine, that's fine
You can go out you can have a good time
But just know at the same time
I can play games too

I been drinkin', floatin'
Caught in my emotions, losing my mind
I been sinking, copin'
Left my heart broken, I don't know why
I been thinkin', hopin'
Can we leave it open, I just need time
I just need time, but why even try

I'm single, I'm single
I'm single, I'm single

Said you had enough and you leaving
Then you wanna call me when you need shit
Tryna grab my heart, playin' defense
Got me drunk texting on the weekend
Way too young to be stressing out
Back with the fellas now
I'm doing better now
Gettin' cheddar now
Big cheese feta now
I was tryna bring you up but you let me down

I been drinkin', floatin'
Caught in my emotions, losing my mind
I been sinking, copin'
Left my heart broken, I don't know why
I been thinkin', hopin'
Can we leave it open, I just need time (I love you but like)
I just need time, but why even try
(I don't know why I'm even trying at this point)

I'm single, I'm single
I'm single, I'm single
I'm single, I'm single
I'm single, I'm single

(Just like time, I'm just trying to figure it out)

up, y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen baby

You didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
Bitch I'm blowin' up

You need to get your shit straight
Jakey, brought me to the top
Now we're really poppin' off
Number 1 and number 4
That's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top
So we all going

Living in the USA
Anyone's dream
Sending dollars to my whole family

His name is Donald Trump and he's at the top.

Started balling, Quicken loans
Now I'm in my flippin' zone

But, that's some shitty clones
Stay in all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said it's 10 with six zeros
Always plug, merch link in bio
And I will see you tomorrow 'cause
It's everyday bro
Peace


Jake Paul
Aye, Gucci? (yah!)
Wanna show 'em how we do it?
Ight, ayo, Sleep, you ready?
Remiiiiiix! Guwop!

It's every day bro, fuck that Disney Channel flow
Every day I film my life, double the views of any show
Nickelodeon hit me up and I said "Hell no!"
And FedEx hit me up, they 'bout to ship my Lambo (skrrt, skrrt!)
And I'm twenty years old, and the haters always fold
And the ice on me, cold, and in nineteen-ninety-seven
A new legend was born, now Jakey shooting haters down
Call me Jason Bourne, got big Gucci on the flow
(Brr, brr, brr!) This shit cold like the snow!
Mansion shopping on the low, they said Jake Paul is over
Sold twelve thousand at the show, it's a Gucci mink coat (ooh)
It's a yacht for the boat private jets to Ohio
So the kids that talk shit can see my life a TV show
And it's every day bro, and you know the house cost seven, man
And you know I just ain't rentin'
And I be in the Aussie, eating shrimp on the barbie
All my exes look like Barbie and I pull up in the 'Rari like
Bling, blow! Oopsie, I just told them the truth (my bad!)
And I just dropped some new merch
And it's still really selling like a fucking God Church!

It's every day bro
It's every day bro
It's every day bro (Gucc)
I said, it's every day bro!

Every day I wake up and get it, that's just me
If I don't grind, then I don't eat 'cause that shit comin' free
I'm all the way in NYC, it's all about the cheese
You gettin' money? So are we, man, I rotate ten-se'nteen
I might pull up in the Lamborghini, paint it green (Guwop!)
Guwop back on the scene, you ain't heard, man, I'm the king (work)
You can call me Wizop or you can call me Gucci (it's Gucci)
Every day, I hate, I hate, he mad because he losing
I rap like I'm producing (uh), but don't know how to do it (no!)
They rappin' bout their Pirus but don't know how to use it (skrrt!)
In nineteen-ninety-seven, I would pull up in a Buick
Now, every day, I'm changing cars, it's kinda gettin' confusing
Every day, my lady make me stand up like I pushed it
And every day, the paparazzi put me in the news clip
And every day, I try not hit nobody with the full clip
From East Atlanta, not the Chi but I'm back on my bullshit
(It's Gucci)
It's every day bro (hey)
It's every day bro
It's every day bro (wow)
I said, it's every day bro!

Forty five bands on the Aston Martin bed
Sleep when I'm dead, Billboard twenty under twenty, so they said
I ain't no musician, I get bread, I'm just sayin'
Bought a Lamb that I slam on the gas to Calabas'
Tryna pass the Kardashians, puttin' diamonds on my doggy too
Team 10, had to let me know
I get more for my clothes than these rappers get for shows
I just hit one hundred up the Malibu coast
And blew a hundred thousand on her
Now your girl a Jake Pauler, bam

It's every day bro
It's every day bro
It's every day bro
I said, it's every day bro!

Jake Paulers!
Album, album coming December first

Used to call you mom but now I call you wifey

Now we're on a honeymoon chillin' in Hawaii
And whenever we kiss, man, it's just so spicy

Get over here, get your mind right
Diamond ring, say my name take my last one
Quavo, you should take your mask off
We should take our pants off
We should make a dance up
Put my ass in a Tesla
Give you all my best love
You make me feel special
That's why I'm down for forever

Something just feels right
When we're together
I think I want to stay here with you for forever
For forever, forever and ever and ugh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever
Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever

See lot of thangs, been around the block
I'll be the best uncle just give me one shot
Just nine months, keep tryin' don't stop
Cause family vloggers are so hot
What's next? I don't know
When it comes to uncles I'll be the best
I'll beat the rest
I'll save the marriage, I stop the stress
All the women like the way I dress
What's next?
Twins in a stroller
Amusement parks and roller coasters
What will I do when they get older?
Strong like winds so I can whip the stroller


Get over here, get your mind right
Diamond ring, say my name take my last one
Quavo, you should take your mask off
We should take our pants off
We should make a dance up
Put my ass in a Tesla

Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever
Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever

They'll be screaming out Jerika
All across America
I think I wanna marry you
I think that's what I gotta do

Let's make some babies, don't be shy
You've been treated badly but I'm your guy
If you were a dude I think I'd die
I think I would fly 'cause I'm your guy
So cute, wanna eat you like a chicken thigh
So sweet just call this shit apple pie
Our love through the roof and out the flippin' sky
Conversations got me like oh my oh my
Uncle Kade in the shed, that shit no lie

Scuba divin' on an island with my diamond like Rihanna
Conversations so amazin', we're just talkin' 'bout my husband
Counting all our blessings, yeah we do this every hour
Concentration automatic, Wonder Woman, super power

When we're together
I think I want to stay here with you for forever
For forever
Something just feels right
When we're together
I think I want to stay here with you for forever
For forever, forever and ever and ugh

Numbers don't lie

Yo. JP
Look, I'm a millionaire, but I ain't used nothin' in my life that my teachers taught me

My teachers never taught me that! (My teachers never taught me that!)
How to deal with this or that!
How to make my papers stack!
How to get a DM back
How to buy a Lambo cash!

My teachers never taught me that! (Yo!)
My teachers never liked me one bit!
They said I would amount to be shit!
They thought I was just another misfit!
I had to make like a banana and split!
Now, Jakey in a mansion
Got 8 builders for expansion!
All these diamonds on my dances
Mrs. Clause just see me flashin'!
My Lambo hit the gas
All these Prius's I'm passin'!
Doin 60 in Calabasas
I feel like Kim Kardashian!

My teachers never taught me that! (My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that!
How to make my papers stack!
How to get a DM back
How to buy a Lambo cash!

My teachers said I needed to get up on my grades
I need to get my Bs and raise them up to the As!
I walk in the class, I got Supreme on my J's
You always tryna hate but you got nothin' to say!
I'm almost at the top, I'm the young Lebron James!
I'm not the same in my own brain
I'm in a different lane!
It's yo girl Sunny and call me Mrs. Stay-On-Top!
I'm on this rocket, killin' the game, and this a bop!

My teachers never taught me that! (My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that!
How to make my papers stack!
How to get a DM back
How to buy a Lambo cash!

Neva' taught me how to flow
And I be on the beats!
Skippin' class all day
There be Fs all on my sheet!
Detentions everyday
Got me kicked off the team!
The teachers never cared about my California Dream! (no)

Just a Nerd like Mc Lovin!
My teacher's frontin
Talkin' shit 'cause I'm nothin'!
Now I'm somethin'
Speaker's bumpin'
Crowd jumpin'
Money comin'
Wrist flooded
Girls lovin' whip stun in!

Saturdays are for the boys
Saturday, let's make some noise
Taco Bell is open late
Slumber parties, movie date
Saturday, I can't complain
Take me back to the good ol' days
Ohio and chasing baes
That's how they made Saturdays
In my Jeep, lots of doors
Pulling up to Gucci stores
Start a fire, cook some s'mores
Down to date and close the door
Yeah, we're here
Yeah, we're lit
Now it's 'Rari's new civics
I ain't sorry, we got hits
Tell the DJ, "Play our shit"

England is my city this Saturday night
Drivin' on the left side of the road tonight
I'm the English Elder this Saturday night
Mini Cooper and your chick to my right
Fish and Chips this Saturday night
Lundage in my Gucci, you can take a flight
Winston Church, you don't wanna fight
I got my Visa last Saturday night
Last Saturday night, last Saturday night

Cheerio

Last Saturday Night
Cheerio, mate

Smoothies are my life
Yo, ginger
Yea
It's smoothie time
But first, let me make a smoothie

Are you ready?
Then white chocolate is ready (shakey)
Well, then, do you know what's 'bout to happen?
DJ, play that beat

I grab the blue, blue berries and I toss 'em in the cup
I did a tango with the mayo, and I slice 'em all up
Where's the pear, where's the pair, I'ma dice 'em all up
I put 'em all in the blender and I shake 'em all up
How many strawberries 'bout to go in the cup?
I said, "Cranberry 'bout to go in the cup"
Mmm, coconut 'bout to go in the cup

I put 'em all in the blender and I shake 'em all up...

I grab the black blackberries and I toss 'em in the cup
And the money with the honey and I toss 'em all up
Now you scared with the cheese, 'bout to toss 'em all up
I put 'em all in the blender and I shake 'em all up
I said, "Strawberry 'bout to go in the cup"
I said, "Pepsi 'bout to go in the cup"
Mmm, pomegranate 'bout to go in the cup

I put 'em all in the blender and I shake 'em all up...

Whip it, sip it, swirl it, twirl it
Drink it, tap it, drip it, curl it
High speed, low speed, do it how ya want
I love smoothies, ain't afraid to fall
Yo, DJ Hymn, fuck 'em, wasn't two

Did you rub the white chocolate?
Can't stop it

Pressure hard, they all watching now
Make a mistake, world on me now
It ain't easy, just a kid from a small town
To every news publication tryna take me down
I'm human too, they want me to lose
Want me in a noose but they ain't tell the truth
Tryna drag my name, tryna stop my game
Don't know the pain, bitch, I know the pain

Man, where was y'all at when I was on email
Tryna stop depressed fans from killin' themselves?
Man, where was y'all at when I was in the kitchen
Whippin' up meals for kids on Thanksgiving?
Where was y'all at when I was with a teacher
Handing out backpacks & handing out t-shirts
Or where was y'all at when Make-A-Wish hit me
To meet my girl, Caylee
Damn, that shit changed me

That ain't on the news
That ain't on the news
You think you know me, but
That ain't on the news
That ain't on your Twitter
That ain't on your Insta
That ain't on your Twitter, man
That ain't on your Insta

This is for all of the liars
Spreading these rumors like a virus
They don't really know nothing 'bout us
They don't know nothing about us

I'm sorry for my actions, man, I'm asking for forgiveness, man
I'm asking you to witness my growth in this business
My growth as kid, shit I know you can't admit it
You know that I kill it, you know my game pippin'
You know the views rippin', you know that I'm a villain
You know the bank chillin', you know you can't stop me
Yeah I know that I'm cocky, you know that I'm trying to not be
Like I said I'm sorry, but I gotta ask man

Where was y'all at when I was in the lunchroom
Stopping kids from getting bullied?
They were scared to come to school, man
Where was y'all at when I was 17 years old and
Living on my own trying to find a way to grow, man?
Where was y'all at when Selena left Disney?
Didn't talk shit to her, but now you talk shit to me
Where was y'all at when the neighbors didn't hate me?
They all wanted pictures, but now they tryna play me

That ain't on the news
That ain't on the news
You think you know me but
That ain't on the news
That ain't on your Twitter
That ain't on your Insta
That ain't on your Twitter man
That ain't on your Insta

This is for all of the liars
Spreading these rumors like a virus
They don't really know nothing 'bout us
They don't know nothing about us
This is for all of the liars
Spreading these rumors like a virus
They don't really know nothing 'bout us
They don't know nothing about us

This is for all of the liars
Spreading these rumors like a virus
They don't really know nothing 'bout us
They don't know nothing about us

All right, what up guys, checking up on you during this part of the song
'Bout to hit it again but, I love you guys
And I wouldn't be anywhere without you, ha

Fastest Youtube channel, to hit 10 Mill (Fact)
I gotta rep England, yeah that's my city(Nick Crompton)
This is our song, yeah, this is out anthem
This is what we sing when the haters be chanting
Can't get views without my name (Fact)
They make sh*t up about my name (Fact)
They pay their bills with my name (Fact)
I give them all their content and fame (Fact)
So please, recognize the facts (That's Facts)
The Jake Paulers always win, you can't stop the pack!

Let me just start off by saying I think my brother is an idiot
It's true
And he can be a real dick sometimes
Also true
But he is my brother
Still true
And I'm always gonna have his back

It's the rise of the Pauls, that's right, the brothers are back
We 'bout to make this shit look easy like a game, Tic Tac
Now, Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe
Pick a YouTuber and roast him slow
(Pick a YouTuber and roast him slow, oh, oh, oh, roast him slow), yah yeet
All of their views be falling like snow
We just bought two Lambos with the butterfly doors
Although, they so below
It's clear that all these other suckers plateaued (fact, fact)
We came in and grabbed YouTube by the balls
I know for a fact it wasn't ready for the Pauls, at all
Early 20s and more talent than y'all
And we ball
Quit YouTube we still crush like a cannonball

Put Jake's name in your title and you can pay this month's rent
We know you're calling your lawyers
Yeah, that's money well spent
Cause yeah, my brother messed up, but he still got his Disney contract
See me in person, I guarantee you won't make eye contact

When the Paul bros unite, the Internet ripples
Don't mess with the best, boy, it's that simple
Yeah, we welcome your fans with open arms
'Cause this a rocket ship that's headed for the stars

Yah, everybody parched, thirsty for the views
But we just havin' some fun
And these dudes like thirty and their names barely worthy to roll off our tongues
Now I can't tell the future
But it's a damn fact that we've just begun
(Hahaha)
Life is only moving faster
Me and Logey 'bout to hit Mach 1

The grind never stops
Only two ways to make it to the top
One: Be a leech, gain your fame from the great ones
Two: Be a Maverick, lead the pack like Napoleon
I choose two, you can ride on my caravan
Plenty of room and number one, got a lifespan

Oh Logan, ah this is like hypocritical
Because I just made video about not hating on people
Yeah, no, I saw the video, yeah
So... I can't do this
I'm bored bro, roast videos are fun
No, they are not
Wait, hold up...
Did you hear that bro?
The the Second verse is coming
Shut up, second verse

It's the second verse, forget about the first
If this a foot race, I'd be running in reverse
Y'all be making memes, but we be making millies

I'm killing this off
Stop Logan
The second verse can never come out
But bro, don't you think we should address that one thing that everyone's like wondering about
No, I'm not talking about that anymore
Bro, but like I'm just like...
No, there two sides to every story and it's not gonna go anywhere
Well, that is true
So, like you don't know who is telling the truth and who is lying, essentially

Hey guys

I'mma go to sleep
Get your Maverick merch

I love you
Logang for life

You got too much pride these days
Too much to hide these days
I used to be the one
They gave the run around
Now they all ride the wave
And it's like a tidal wave and when it come down and it crash, you know I got you, babe
You complain about my distance, we a flight away
For the night you stay
Get your mind off things
Got a man back at home
So this ain't right you say
That's alright with me
But we grown now, we alone now
Let me show you wassup

We got a history, this ain't a mystery
All them excuses, you dealin' with other things
I know you doin' well, you got a life ahead
Don't get too caught up, yeah, that's what your mother say
She only see us when we on the internet
She used to love me but I gave her trust away
I got a heart for you, no one can have it
I'm here with a passion when you wanna run away
And when you call up my phone, you know I'll pick up
Just like we back at home, I'll never give up
Late night drives through the O
I won't forget 'em, wear my sweatshirt through the snow
And you gon' forget me, I need your forgiveness
The fact that I'm here is my reason I moved to L.A., I got famous as fuck
But I'm here like I need your attention
Remember the times in Ohio when I always said that I wouldn't forget you
And I get my pride in the mix all the time
But won't lie, girl, I'll tell you I miss you
And your love a drug to me
Girl, do you fuck with me?
I'm tryna take you to my side of town
And give you all the luxuries, but I need your company
Need you to run with me
When it all comes back down to it, do you fuck with me?

You got too much pride these days
Too much to hide these days
I used to be the one
They gave the run around
Now they all ride the wave
And it's like a tidal wave and when it come down and it crash, you know I got you, babe
You complain about my distance, we a flight away
For the night you stay
Get your mind off things
Got a man back at home
So this ain't right you say
That's alright with me
But we grown now, we alone now
Let me show you wassup
