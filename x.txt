Think you ain't beautiful, stop that
Think you ain't worth it, stop that
Think you ain't loved for, stop that
Bully who you are, better stop that
Making people sad, you can stop that
Giving people love, don't stop that
Taking people's lives, you can stop that

I'm myself, you is you
Don't let nobody get through
They can talk, they can hate
But you stay bulletproof
They make stories, you don't listen
They realize who they missing
You beautiful, you strong
They won't be there for long
Just stay true to yourself
Don't give up, don't cry
Telling you, I've been there too
You don't gotta keep it inside
Plus they pause and you're worth it
Get back up cuz you won't quit
Keep that smile, keep dreaming
You can do it, you deserve it

Think you ain't good enough, stop that
Think you ain't beautiful, stop that
Think you ain't worth it, stop that
Think you ain't loved for, stop that

Giving people love, don't stop that
Taking people's lives, you can stop that

Do what you love, don't let anybody tell you different

Now we strong, not broken
Ain't got time for folks who's trolling
Living moments, fast cars rolling
Lost our way but now we're home in
inhale sound I feel so much better
Love life on my own trendsetter
I've been silent, now expressing
How my life's my greatest blessing
I'm gone

Think you ain't good enough, stop that
Think you ain't beautiful, stop that
Think you ain't worth it, stop that
Think you ain't loved for, stop that
Bully who you are, better stop that
Making people sad, you can stop that
Giving people love, don't stop that
Taking people's lives, you can stop that

Think you ain't good enough, stop that
Think you ain't beautiful, stop that
Think you ain't worth it, stop that
Think you ain't loved for, stop that
Bully who you are, better stop that
Making people sad, you can stop that
Giving people love, don't stop that
